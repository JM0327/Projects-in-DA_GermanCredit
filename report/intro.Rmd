“The German Credit data has data on 1000 past credit applicants, described by 30 variables. Each applicant is rated as "Good" or "Bad" credit (encoded as 1 and 0 respectively in the response variable). We want to obtain a model that may be used to determine if new applicants present a good or bad credit risk.”   

In this case, we are planning to use both CART model and Clustering to do the analysis.
